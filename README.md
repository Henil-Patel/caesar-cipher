# caesar-cipher
  This is part of Duke University Java Course 2.  Introduction to OOP using decrypting / encrypting Caesar Cipher.
  Other topics also include WordPlay and WordLengt which is more for string parsing and manipulation using a combination of looping and conditionals. 
  This is all done to build up styling knowledge of the CaesarCipher class. Finally an OOP version is introduced with some code for having two keys to
  encrypt the plain text paving way for the Vigenere cipher (done in a separate repo).
